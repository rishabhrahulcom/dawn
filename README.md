How to implement a Connection pool 

How to implement Thread pool. 
Why do we need a connection/thread pool? 
How to implement Blocking Queue 
Explain the architecture of your current project 
Explain different layers in microservices, How to configure load balancing 
Difference between Hashmap and treemap 
What is the implementation to use a class as a key in a tree map 
Streams - find minimum number from a integer list 
Lambdas, functional interface 
How do you Sort numbers(which are comma separated) from a file. Size of the file is 100 GB. Assume you can load only 10 GB of data on java memory. 
 
1. How to make a class immutable
2. Design a java class to make sure only one object of that class and only one object of each child class can be created, if we try to create 2nd object of the class itself or 2nd object of any child class, it should throw exception
3. A question on run time polymorphism
4. how to sort a List<Emp> based on id,name,salary using comparable and comparator interfaces.
5. How to create your own thread executor service.
6. experience in RestFul APIs, Spring boot, Spring data and Spring microservices
7. Java collections, data structures and SQL concepts
8. basic sorting techniques using comparable or comparator interface.Basics of Collections.sort -> comparator comparable on multiple fields
9. Polymorphism -> dynamic method dispatch/static -> solve questions form indiabix or other websites
10. JVM internals -> in depth
11. Solve leetcode -> multithreading/concurrency questions Implement your own concurrent hash map, hash map, tree map, executor framework
12. String internals
13. JDBC
14. SQL queries -> practice all department employee queries -> watch kudvenkat SQL interview questions.
15. Basics of Collections.sort -> comparator comparable on multiple fields.
16. Implement your own concurrent hash map, hash map, tree map, executor framework 


  

Can you override main method?
No, if the child class is having another main method. The JVM will call the parents method. 

Parents child static methods call
